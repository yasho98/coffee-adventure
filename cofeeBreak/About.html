            <h1>Our Story</h1>
            <p>Welcome to Coffee Brake, where every cup tells a story.<br>We are a family-owned coffee shop that takes pride in sourcing <br>the best beans and crafting the perfect cup of coffee for you to enjoy.</p>
            <p>Our story began when Mr. P. de Almeida fell in love with coffee during a trip to Brazil.<br> He was fascinated by the process of roasting and brewing and decided to bring that passion back home to Wennappuwa.<br> Mr. P. de Almeida started roasting his own beans in his garage and soon, word spread about his exceptional coffee.<br> The rest, as they say, is history.</p>
            <p>At Coffee Brake, we believe that coffee is more than just a drink - it's an experience.<br> That's why we take care to roast our beans in small batches, to ensure that each cup is bursting with flavor.<br> Our baristas are passionate about coffee and are always happy to share their knowledge with you,<br> whether you're a coffee connoisseur or just getting started.</p>
            <p>We also believe in giving back to our community.<br> That's why we source our beans from ethical and sustainable farms,<br> and why we partner with local organizations to support causes that are important to us.<br> We are committed to making a positive impact on the world, one cup of coffee at a time.</p>
            <p>Thank you for joining us on this journey.<br> We look forward to sharing our love of coffee with you and hope that every cup brings you joy and inspiration.</p>
